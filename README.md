# Map App

**Map App** is a C++ application developed using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) as part of my Semester 3 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project. This application visualizes graph structures overlaid on a map, enabling users to input 'From' and 'To' node IDs to compute and highlight the shortest path between them.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Interactive User Interface:**
  - Input boxes for specifying source and destination nodes.
  - Buttons to trigger pathfinding actions.
  - Dynamic window resizing to maintain UI consistency.
  
- **Graph Visualization:**
  - Displays nodes and edges on a map.
  - Highlights the computed shortest path for easy visualization.
  
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:**
  - Implements efficient algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's) to determine the shortest path between nodes.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs or when no path is found.
  
- **Responsive Design:**
  - UI elements adjust their positions based on window size changes to ensure a seamless user experience.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **C++:** The core programming language used for development.
- **SFML:** Utilized for rendering graphics, handling window events, and managing user interactions.
- **Git:** Version control system to manage and track project changes.
